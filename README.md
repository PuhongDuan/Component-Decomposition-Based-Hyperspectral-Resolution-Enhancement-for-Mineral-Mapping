ABSTRACT = {Combining both spectral and spatial information with enhanced resolution provides not only elaborated qualitative information on surfacing mineralogy but also mineral interactions of abundance, mixture, and structure. This enhancement in the resolutions helps geomineralogic features such as small intrusions and mineralization become detectable. In this paper, we investigate the potential of the resolution enhancement of hyperspectral images (HSIs) with the guidance of RGB images for mineral mapping. In more detail, a novel resolution enhancement method is proposed based on component decomposition. Inspired by the principle of the intrinsic image decomposition (IID) model, the HSI is viewed as the combination of a reflectance component and an illumination component. Based on this idea, the proposed method is comprised of several steps. First, the RGB image is transformed into the luminance component, blue-difference and red-difference chroma components (YCbCr), and the luminance channel is considered as the illumination component of the HSI with an ideal high spatial resolution. Then, the reflectance component of the ideal HSI is estimated with the downsampled HSI image and the downsampled luminance channel. Finally, the HSI with high resolution can be reconstructed by utilizing the obtained illumination and the reflectance components. Experimental results verify that the fused results can successfully achieve mineral mapping, producing better results qualitatively and quantitatively over single sensor data.},
